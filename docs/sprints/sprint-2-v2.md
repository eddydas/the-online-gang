7. **Game History:** No win/loss tracking visualization
8. **Avatar System:** Generic "Player X" names, no emoji avatars
9. **Copy Link UX:** Missing prominent share functionality
10. **Mobile Optimization:** Not tested/optimized for mobile Safari

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Animations performance on mobile**
   - Mitigation: Use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated), test early

2. **Sound API browser compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Web Audio API is well-supported; graceful degradation if needed

3. **Time constraints for all features**
   - Mitigation: Prioritize CRITICAL items first; defer MEDIUM items if needed

### Deferred to Sprint 3 (if needed)
- Advanced animations (particle effects, etc.)
- Additional sound varieties
- Complex visual effects
- Non-critical polish items

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 60fps animations on iPhone 12+ (Safari iOS)
- [ ] <100ms UI response time for all interactions
- [ ] Zero critical bugs
- [ ] All CRITICAL tasks completed
- [ ] Responsive design works on 320px - 1920px viewports

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] New players can understand game without explanation
- [ ] Poker rankings are accessible within 2 clicks
- [ ] Host can share game link within 3 seconds
- [ ] Token trading feels responsive and smooth
- [ ] Visual hierarchy guides players through each phase

## Notes for Team

1. **Focus on Mobile First:** Safari iOS is the primary target. Test early and often.

2. **Animation Performance:** Use `transform` and `opacity` for smooth 60fps animations. Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`.

3. **Sound Implementation:** Be mindful of autoplay policies. First sound must be triggered by user interaction.

4. **Accessibility Consideration:** While not a Sprint 2 requirement, use semantic HTML and consider keyboard navigation where possible.

5. **Test Coverage:** Maintain >80% test coverage for game logic (already achieved in Sprint 1). UI tests are optional but recommended for critical flows.

6. **Design Consistency:** Refer to REQUIREMENTS.md for color scheme (green felt, gray background) and visual theme guidelines.

## Handoff to Sprint 3

Sprint 3 will focus on:
- Advanced features (if any Sprint 2 items deferred)
- Reconnection & persistence (30-min localStorage window)
- Host controls (kick player, game abandonment)
- Production deployment & hosting
- Final bug fixes and optimization
