# Issue 1.2: Card System (TDD)

**Sprint:** 1
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Estimate:** 12 hours
**Status:** TODO

## Description
Implement the card deck system with dealing functionality following TDD approach.

## Tests First (Write These Before Implementation)
- [ ] Deck has 52 cards (13 ranks × 4 suits)
- [ ] Shuffle randomizes order (no duplicates)
- [ ] Deal 2 hole cards per player
- [ ] Deal 3/1/1 community cards per turn (flop/turn/river)
- [ ] Card back color randomized per game (blue or red)

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] 52-card deck creation function
- [ ] Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- [ ] Deal hole cards function (2 per player)
- [ ] Deal community cards function (3/1/1 pattern)
- [ ] Card back color randomization (once per game)

## Type Safety
All functions must have JSDoc type annotations:
```javascript
// @ts-check

/**
 * @typedef {Object} Card
 * @property {string} rank - Card rank (2-10, J, Q, K, A)
 * @property {string} suit - Card suit (♠, ♥, ♦, ♣)
 */

/**
 * @typedef {'blue' | 'red'} CardBackColor
 */
```

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/cards.js` - Card system implementation
- `tests/cards.test.js` - Comprehensive tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] 100% code coverage for card module
- [ ] Type checking passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] All functions have JSDoc type annotations

## Notes
- **Note:** `src/deck.js` already exists with basic deck creation and shuffle. This issue extends it with dealing functionality or creates a more complete `src/cards.js` module.
- Simple UI not required for this issue (logic only)
