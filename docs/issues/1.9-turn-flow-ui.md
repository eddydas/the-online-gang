# Issue 1.9: Turn Flow UI

**Sprint:** 1
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Estimate:** 8 hours
**Status:** TODO

## Description
Implement the turn flow UI for ready-up, token trading, and turn completion phases.

## Tasks
- [ ] Ready-up phase UI (all players must ready)
- [ ] Token trading phase UI (buttons for tokens)
- [ ] Turn complete phase UI (all players proceed)
- [ ] Block turn progression if any player not ready/proceeded
- [ ] Phase indicator text ("Press Ready when ready", "Take a token...", etc.)
- [ ] Player status indicators (who is ready/not ready)

## HTML Structure
```html
<div id="game-screen">
  <div id="phase-indicator">
    <!-- "Waiting for players to ready up..." -->
    <!-- "Select your token" -->
    <!-- "Waiting for players to proceed..." -->
  </div>

  <div id="ready-phase" class="hidden">
    <button id="ready-button">Ready</button>
  </div>

  <div id="token-trading-phase" class="hidden">
    <div id="token-pool">
      <!-- Token buttons 1 to N -->
    </div>
    <button id="proceed-button" disabled>Proceed to Next Turn</button>
  </div>

  <div id="player-status">
    <!-- Show which players are ready/not ready -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Type Safety
```javascript
// @ts-check

/**
 * Renders ready-up phase UI
 * @param {GameState} state - Current game state
 * @returns {void}
 */

/**
 * Renders token trading phase UI
 * @param {GameState} state - Current game state
 * @returns {void}
 */

/**
 * Updates phase indicator text
 * @param {GamePhase} phase - Current phase
 * @param {string[]} waitingFor - Player names waiting for
 * @returns {void}
 */
```

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/ui/turnFlow.js` - Turn flow UI rendering
- `src/ui/phaseIndicator.js` - Phase indicator component
- `tests/ui/turnFlow.test.js` - UI tests (optional for Sprint 1)
- Update `index.html` with structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Ready-up phase shows "Ready" button
- [ ] Token trading shows all N tokens as buttons
- [ ] Turn complete shows "Proceed" button
- [ ] Phase indicator shows clear text per phase
- [ ] Player status shows who is ready/not ready
- [ ] Progression blocked until unanimous ready/proceed
- [ ] Proper HTML structure (semantic tags)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`npm run typecheck`)

## Phase Indicator Messages
- **CARD_DEAL:** "Dealing cards..."
- **READY_UP:** "Press Ready when you've reviewed your cards"
- **READY_UP (waiting):** "Waiting for: Alice, Bob..."
- **TOKEN_TRADING:** "Select your token"
- **TURN_COMPLETE (waiting):** "Waiting for players to proceed: Charlie..."

## Interaction Flow
1. Cards dealt → show hole cards
2. Ready button appears → player clicks
3. Wait for all players → show waiting message
4. All ready → token trading begins
5. Player selects token → "Proceed" button enabled
6. Player clicks proceed → wait for all
7. All proceed → advance to next turn

## Notes
- Simple styling (full polish in Sprint 2)
- No animations (deferred to Sprint 3)
- Focus on functionality and proper state management
