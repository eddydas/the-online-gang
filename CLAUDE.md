# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**The Online Gang** is a cooperative P2P multiplayer card game (2-8 players) where players use token trading to communicate hand strength. Built with vanilla JavaScript, peer.js, and TDD methodology.

**Tech Stack:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) - no frameworks, no transpiling
- peer.js for P2P WebRTC connections
- Vitest for testing
- JSDoc + TypeScript for type safety (validation only, no compilation)
- Target: Safari (iOS, macOS, Vision Pro)

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage report (80% threshold)

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/deck.test.js

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should create a deck"
```

### Type Checking
```bash
npm run typecheck          # Type check all JS files (no emit)
npm run lint               # Alias for typecheck
```

### Coverage Requirements
- **Sprint 1:** >80% (game logic)
- **Sprint 2-3:** >75% (with UI/animations)
- **Sprint 4:** >90% (production)

## Architecture & Game Logic

### Game Mechanics (Critical to Understand)

**Cooperative Win Condition:**
- ALL players must correctly select tokens (1 to N) matching their hand strength
- Everyone wins together or loses together
- **Critical edge case:** Players with identical hands (same rank AND kickers) can swap tokens and still win

**Token Trading System:**
- Players select numbered tokens from central pool
- **Token stealing:** Players can take tokens from others (core communication mechanic)
- Conflict resolution: timestamp-based (earlier selection wins)
- 4 turns with full token history tracking

**Game Flow:**
```
LOBBY (initial join only)
  ‚Üì
CARD_DEAL ‚Üí READY_UP ‚Üí TOKEN_TRADING ‚Üí TURN_COMPLETE
    ‚Üë                                         ‚Üì
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (repeat 4 turns) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
                          ‚Üì (after turn 4)
                       END_GAME
                          ‚Üì
            "Ready for Next Game" button
                          ‚Üì
                   (back to CARD_DEAL)
```

**Important:** Game does NOT return to lobby after END_GAME. Uses "Ready for Next Game" button for seamless continuous play.

### P2P Architecture (peer.js)

**Host Authority Model:**
- First player (host) is the single source of truth
- Host generates shareable link with peer ID
- Clients connect via URL parameter
- All state mutations happen on host, then broadcast to clients
- State sync: `host ‚Üí all clients` (unidirectional)

**Deferred to Post-MVP:**
- Reconnection logic
- Session persistence
- Host/client disconnect recovery

### Type Safety Pattern (JSDoc + TypeScript)

All JavaScript files must follow this pattern:

```javascript
// @ts-check

/**
 * @typedef {Object} Card
 * @property {string} rank - Card rank (2-10, J, Q, K, A)
 * @property {string} suit - Card suit (‚ô†, ‚ô•, ‚ô¶, ‚ô£)
 */

/**
 * Shuffles a deck using Fisher-Yates algorithm
 * @param {Card[]} deck - The deck to shuffle
 * @returns {Card[]} The shuffled deck (new array, original unchanged)
 */
function shuffleDeck(deck) { /* ... */ }
```

- `@ts-check` directive at top of every file
- `@typedef` for all data structures
- Type all function parameters and return values
- TypeScript compiler validates but doesn't compile (noEmit: true)

### Core Data Structures (To Implement)

**GameState:**
```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {Object} GameState
 * @property {string} phase - LOBBY | CARD_DEAL | READY_UP | TOKEN_TRADING | TURN_COMPLETE | END_GAME
 * @property {number} turn - Current turn (1-4)
 * @property {Player[]} players - All players (2-8)
 * @property {Card[]} deck - Shuffled deck
 * @property {Card[]} communityCards - Shared cards (max 5)
 * @property {Token[]} tokens - Available tokens (1 to N)
 * @property {'blue'|'red'} cardBackColor - Randomized once per game
 */
```

**Player:**
```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {Object} Player
 * @property {string} id - Unique peer ID
 * @property {string} name - Display name (max 20 chars)
 * @property {Card[]} holeCards - 2 private cards
 * @property {number|null} currentToken - Selected token number
 * @property {number[]} tokenHistory - Tokens per turn (length 4)
 * @property {boolean} isReady - Ready state
 * @property {boolean} isHost - Host flag
 * @property {string} emoji - Avatar emoji
 */
```

**HandResult:**
```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {Object} HandResult
 * @property {number} rank - Hand rank (1-10, higher = better)
 * @property {string} name - "High Card" | "Pair" | "Two Pair" | ... | "Royal Flush"
 * @property {Card[]} bestFive - Best 5 cards from 7 available
 * @property {number[]} tiebreakers - Kicker values for comparison
 * @property {string} description - Full hand description
 */
```

### Poker Hand Rankings (1-10)
1. High Card
2. Pair
3. Two Pair
4. Three of a Kind
5. Straight
6. Flush
7. Full House
8. Four of a Kind
9. Straight Flush
10. Royal Flush

**Kicker Logic:** When comparing hands of same rank, use tiebreaker array (e.g., A-A-K beats A-A-Q because K > Q).

## TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)

**For every feature:**
1. Write failing test first
2. Run test (confirm red)
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Run test (confirm green)
5. Refactor
6. Run test (confirm still green)
7. **BEFORE COMMIT:** Run both verification commands:
   - `npm test` - All tests must pass
   - `npm run typecheck` - No TypeScript errors allowed
8. Commit only when both pass

**Test file location:** `tests/[module].test.js`

**Example pattern:**
```javascript
// tests/poker.test.js
import { evaluateHand } from '../src/browser/poker.js';

describe('Poker Hand Evaluation', () => {
  test('should recognize a pair of Aces', () => {
    const hand = [
      { rank: 'A', suit: '‚ô†' },
      { rank: 'A', suit: '‚ô•' },
      // ... 5 more cards
    ];
    const result = evaluateHand(hand);
    expect(result.name).toBe('Pair');
    expect(result.rank).toBe(2);
  });
});
```

**CRITICAL: Always verify before commit:**
```bash
npm test              # Must pass
npm run typecheck     # Must have no errors
git add ...
git commit ...
```

## Implementation Rules

### Build for N Players from Day 1
- ‚ùå Don't: Build for 2 players, then scale to 8
- ‚úÖ Do: Build for 2-8 players from start (use dynamic N everywhere)

### End-Game Table is CORE (Sprint 1)
- **Not polish** - essential feature in first sprint
- Shows: 4 token history columns + 7 cards + hand description
- Turn 4 tokens highlighted (green = correct, red = incorrect)
- WIN/LOSS banner at top

### Ready-Up from Day 1
- ‚ùå Don't: Build host-controlled flow, then replace
- ‚úÖ Do: Implement ready-up system immediately

### Proper HTML Structure from Day 1
- ‚ùå Don't: Build ugly then redesign
- ‚úÖ Do: Semantic HTML from start, style in Sprint 2
- Cards as `<div>`, tokens as `<button>`, proper table structure

## Edge Cases to Remember

1. **Tied hands can swap tokens:** Players with identical hands (A-A-K-Q-J vs A-A-K-Q-J) can have either token order and still win
2. **Late joiners:** Show lobby screen, wait for current game to finish (can't join mid-game)
3. **Token stealing:** Uses timestamp conflict resolution (earlier selection wins)
4. **Card back color:** Randomized once per game (blue or red), not per card
5. **Host authority:** All state changes must originate from host
6. **No return to lobby:** After END_GAME, use "Ready for Next Game" button (seamless continuous play, not "Play Again")

## Current Sprint

**Sprint 1:** Core Game Engine + End Game (Week 1-2)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Test infrastructure (Vitest)
- ‚úÖ Type safety (JSDoc + TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ Deck module (100% coverage, fully typed)

**Next Steps (see `docs/sprints/sprint-1.md`):**
1. Poker hand evaluation (TDD)
2. Token system (TDD)
3. Win/loss determination (TDD)
4. P2P connection setup
5. Game state machine (TDD)
6. Lobby system
7. End-game summary table
