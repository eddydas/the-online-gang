# The Online Gang - TDD Fast-Track MVP Plan

## Overview
**Approach: Test-Driven Development from Day 1**
- Write tests first, then implementation
- Unit tests for all game logic
- End-game table is CORE, not polish
- Front-load functionality, defer only visual polish

**Timeline:** 5 weeks to production-ready MVP
**Team Size:** 1-2 developers
**Platform:** Web (Safari primary)
